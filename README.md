# Executive Summary:

Credit card fraud has become an increasingly prevalent issue in today's digital age.
Sophisticated cybercriminals employ various tactics, from phishing scams to data breaches, to steal sensitive financial information. As a result, the financial burden on individuals and businesses is substantial. To combat this growing threat, robust fraud detection systems are essential. These systems utilize advanced algorithms and machine learning to analyze transaction patterns, identify anomalies, and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. By proactively detecting and mitigating fraud, financial institutions can safeguard their customers' assets and maintain trust. Â 

# Introduction:
 
This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to develop a robust and efficient credit card fraud detection system. By analyzing vast amounts of transaction data, the model will identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity, enabling real-time detection and prevention of financial losses. This research will explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to optimize fraud detection accuracy and minimize false positives, ultimately contributing to a more secure financial ecosystem.

The primary objective of this project is to predict credit card fraud

**2. Data Sourcing:**
The dataset for this project was sourced from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud

**3. Variables**

- Distance from home **:** This could indicate unusual transaction locations.

- Distance from last transaction **:** Large distances might suggest fraudulent activity.

- Ratio to median purchase price **:** Outliers in purchase amounts can be indicative of fraud.

- Repeat retailer **:** Frequent transactions at the same retailer might be normal or fraudulent, depending on other factors.

- Used chip **:** This could be relevant if chip-based transactions are more secure.

- Used pin number **:** PIN usage might correlate with fraud risk.

- Online order **:** Online transactions often have fraud patterns that are different from those in-store.

- Fraud **:** This is the target variable, indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
We conducted an in-depth investigation and evaluation of the raw data.
